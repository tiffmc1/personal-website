## About The Creator

<p>I am a graduate of Fullstack Academy's Web Development program, where I acquired a solid foundation in JavaScript, Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology with a minor in Legal Studies from The University of Arkansas. This diverse educational background has equipped me with a unique skill set that combines analytical thinking, problem-solving, and a strong attention to detail.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have continuously sought opportunities for personal and technical growth. After obtaining my degree, I pursued another passion of mine, acting, which brought me to the vibrant city of New York. It was during this time that I discovered coding and realized it was the perfect intersection of logic and creativity that I had been seeking. The ability to learn and grow while building solutions that have the potential to positively impact others is what truly excites me about technology.

My experience in the hospitality industry has allowed me to develop exceptional people skills and a customer-centric mindset. Working closely with diverse teams and handling high-pressure situations has honed my ability to communicate effectively, collaborate, and adapt in dynamic environments. These interpersonal skills, coupled with my technical expertise, enable me to bridge the gap between technology and end-users needs seamlessly.

What sets me apart is my ability to leverage my technical skills and analytical mindset to build robust web applications while understanding the human element in every interaction. I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging my problem-solving skills to contribute to the team's success. I am not afraid to seek out answers and resources when faced with challenges, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and expand my knowledge.

In my off-time, I like to edit videos as I am self-taught using Adobe Premiere Pro! I also enjoy the outdoors, usually in the form of hiking, backpacking, and camping. I'm also always listening to music, whether it be rock, pop, classical, EDM, or jazz, and love going to concerts. I am also a huge film and tv buff and love having in-depth discussions about movies, television, and/or anime.

I am a highly adaptable, determined, and curious person who values exploration and ingenuity.</p>
