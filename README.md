## About The Creator
<p>I'm a recent graduate from Fullstack Academy, a web development bootcamp in NYC, that focused on JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Redux. I also have a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from the University of Arkansas in 2014. I moved to NYC after graduation to pursue a career in the arts and studied in that field until 2021 when I was introduced to coding. It was a light-bulb moment for me and ever since I've been doing nothing but programming

Software engineering is the perfect balance between logic and creativity. For me, it brought together the desire to work in a science-related field, but also have a career that wasn't mundane and always sought growth, knowledge, and inventiveness. I've always been the type of person to have many interests/hobbies, which made it difficult to choose just one career path. However, after I began to code, all of those "what if" thoughts ceased to exist. I stopped asking myself "what if I tried this path..." and instead put my entire focus on learning to be a better programmer

In my off-time, I like to edit videos as I am self-taught using Adobe Premiere Pro! I also enjoy the outdoors, usually in the form of hiking, backpacking, and/or camping. I'm always listening to music, whether it be rock, pop, classical, EDM, jazz, etc., and love going to concerts. I am also a huge film and tv buff and love having in-depth discussions about movies, television, and/or anime

I am a highly adaptable, determined, and curious person who values exploration and ingenuity</p>
