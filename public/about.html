					<h1>Hello! My name is Tiffany</h1>

					<p>
						I am a graduate of Fullstack Academy's Web Development program,
						where I acquired a solid foundation in JavaScript, Node.js, React,
						and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree in
						Biology with a minor in Legal Studies from The University of
						Arkansas. This diverse educational background has equipped me with a
						unique skill set that combines analytical thinking, problem-solving,
						and a strong attention to detail.
					</p>

					<p>
						Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have continuously
						sought opportunities for personal and technical growth. After
						obtaining my degree, I pursued another passion of mine, acting,
						which brought me to the vibrant city of New York. It was during this
						time that I discovered coding and realized it was the perfect
						intersection of logic and creativity that I had been seeking. The
						ability to learn and grow while building solutions that have the
						potential to positively impact others is what truly excites me about
						technology.
					</p>

					<p>
						My experience in the hospitality industry has allowed me to develop
						exceptional people skills and a customer-centric mindset. Working
						closely with diverse teams and handling high-pressure situations has
						honed my ability to communicate effectively, collaborate, and adapt
						in dynamic environments. These interpersonal skills, coupled with my
						technical expertise, enable me to bridge the gap between technology
						and end-users needs seamlessly.
					</p>

					<p>
						What sets me apart is my ability to leverage my technical skills and
						analytical mindset to build robust web applications while
						understanding the human element in every interaction. I thrive in
						collaborative environments, leveraging my problem-solving skills to
						contribute to the team's success. I am not afraid to seek out
						answers and resources when faced with challenges, and I am always
						eager to learn new technologies and expand my knowledge.
					</p>

					<p>
						In my off-time, I like to edit videos as I am self-taught using
						Adobe Premiere Pro! I also enjoy the outdoors, usually in the form
						of hiking, backpacking, or camping. I'm also always listening to
						music, whether it be rock, pop, classical, EDM, or jazz, and love
						going to concerts. I am also a huge film and tv buff and love having
						in-depth discussions about movies, television, and/or anime.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am a highly adaptable, determined, and curious person who values
						exploration and ingenuity.
					</p>
