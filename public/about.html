					<h1>Hello! My name is Tiffany</h1>

					<p>
						I'm a recent graduate from Fullstack Academy, a web development
						bootcamp in NYC, that focused on JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL,
						React, and Redux. I also have a Bachelor of Science degree in
						Biology from the University of Arkansas in 2014. I moved to NYC
						after graduation to pursue a career in the arts and studied in that
						field until 2021 when I was introduced to coding. It was a
						light-bulb moment for me and ever since I've been doing nothing but
						programming
					</p>

					<p>
						Software engineering is the perfect balance between logic and
						creativity. For me, it brought together the desire to work in a
						science-related field, but also have a career that wasn't mundane
						and always sought growth, knowledge, and inventiveness. I've always
						been the type of person to have many interests/hobbies, which made
						it difficult to choose just one career path. However, after I began
						to code, all of those "what if" thoughts ceased to exist. I stopped
						asking myself "what if I tried this path..." and instead put my
						entire focus on learning to be a better programmer
					</p>

					<p>
						In my off-time, I like to edit videos as I am self-taught using
						Adobe Premiere Pro! I also enjoy the outdoors, usually in the form
						of hiking, backpacking, and/or camping. I'm always listening to
						music, whether it be rock, pop, classical, EDM, jazz, etc., and love
						going to concerts and festivals. I am also a huge film and tv buff
						and love having in-depth discussions about movies, television,
						and/or anime
					</p>

					<p>
						I am a highly adaptable, determined, and curious person who values
						exploration and ingenuity
					</p>
