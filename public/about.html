						<h1>Hello! Thank you for visiting my website</h1>

						<p>
							My name is Tiffany (Tiff) McNerlin. I am a recent graduate of
							Grace Hopper's full-time web-immersive program at Fullstack
							Academy and hold a Bachelor's Degree in Biology with a minor in
							Legal Studies. After obtaining my bachelor's, I gave myself time
							to pursue another passion -- acting -- which brought me to NYC
						</p>

						<p>
							I am the type of person who has many interests/hobbies but has
							always struggled with choosing just one to serve as my career.
							That is until I found coding. When I first looked into software
							development, it was then that I found my missing link. Coding is
							both the logical and creative career that I desire, and through
							the Grace Hopper program, I learned the necessary tools to build
							full-stack web and mobile applications
						</p>

						<p>
							The technical skills I feel strongest in would be JavaScript,
							Node.js, and React. I also have familiarity using Redux,
							React-Redux, React Native, Firebase v9, Express, and Sequelize.
							This website was built solely using HTML5, CSS, and a tiny bit of
							JavaScript
						</p>

						<p>
							Other hobbies would include video editing as I am self-taught in
							using Adobe Premiere Pro! I also own 40+ houseplants (yes,
							seriously), which might seem like a lot, but once I land my first
							tech job I aim to purchase some of those rare plants found on my
							<a class="shameless-plug" href="portfolio-rare-plant-shop.html"
								>Rare Plant Shop</a
							>! Random interests of mine include music,
							anime/movies/television, hiking/backpacking, snowboarding, and
							napping with my two dogs -- the latter being quite important.
							Please feel free to connect via my socials located below
						</p>

						<p>
							I am a highly adaptable and curious person who values exploration
							and ingenuity
						</p>

						<p>Live long and prosper</p>
