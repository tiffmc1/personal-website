						<h1>Hello! Thank you for visiting my website</h1>

						<p>
							My name is Tiffany McNerlin. I am a recent graduate of Grace
							Hopper's full-time web-immersive program at Fullstack Academy and
							hold a Bachelor's Degree in Biology with a minor in Legal Studies.
							After obtaining my bachelor's, I gave myself time to pursue
							another passion -- acting -- which brought me to NYC
						</p>

						<p>
							I am the type of person who has many interests/hobbies but has
							always struggled with choosing just one to serve as my career.
							That is until I found coding. When I first looked into software
							development, it was then that I found my missing link. Coding is
							both the logical and creative career that I desire, and through
							the Grace Hopper program, I learned the necessary tools to build
							full-stack web applications. For more information about my
							professional background and skillset, check out my
							<a class="resume-plug" href="resume.html">resume</a> page
						</p>

						<p>
							In my off-time, when I am not coding, I like to edit videos as I
							am self-taught using Adobe Premiere Pro! I also enjoy the
							outdoors, usually in the form of hiking, backpacking, and/or
							camping. I'm always listening to new or old music and love going
							to concerts and festivals. I am also a huge film and tv buff and
							love having in-depth discussions about movies, television, and/or
							anime. Lastly, I love playing Pokemon GO! Yes, seriously. Add me
							as a friend! (trainer name/code: MosephDouglas, 9038 8188 3617)
						</p>

						<p>
							I am a highly adaptable and curious person who values exploration
							and ingenuity
						</p>

						<p>Live long and prosper</p>
